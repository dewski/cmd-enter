# cmd-enter

Every textarea should let you submit comments by pressing cmd-enter or
ctrl-enter. For every site that doesn't support it, a kitten weeps. Here's
to making less kittens weep.

## Requirements

- [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs)

## Supported Sites

- [dribbble](https://github.com/dewski/cmd-enter/blob/master/dribbble.com.js)
- [hackernews](https://github.com/dewski/cmd-enter/blob/master/news.ycombinator.com.js)
- [reddit](https://github.com/dewski/cmd-enter/blob/master/reddit.com.js)
- [twitter](https://github.com/dewski/cmd-enter/blob/master/twitter.com.js)
- [stackoverflow](https://github.com/dewski/cmd-enter/blob/master/stackoverflow.com.js)

## Contributing

If reddit.com is giving you a bad time and not letting you use cmd-enter
to submit comments, just create a reddit.js.com file and add the JavaScript
required to submit comments (example below). jQuery is available from dotjs
regardless if the target site has it or not. Some sites may require multiple
event listeners if they format their textareas differently throughout their
site.

Here is an example of adding cmd-enter to reddit.com:

```js
$(document).on('keydown', '.usertext-edit textarea', function(e) {
  if(e.keyCode == 13 && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {
    $(this).parents('form').submit()
  }
})
```

Hints:

- `.usertext-edit textarea` is the selector for all textareas we are listening to.
- `e.keyCode == 13` - 13 here is the enter key.
- `(e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)` is either the command key or ctrl key.
